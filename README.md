# Spark_Scala_Demos
This repo contains some demos and proof of concepts for using spark.  
This includes:<br>
    **Clustering and Anomaly Detection on Streaming Spark**<br>
    **Colloborative Filtering with Spark**
  
I have also given a talk to the Chicago Spark users group on the issues around using spark for data science.
